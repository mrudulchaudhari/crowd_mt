#Set up

VENV
In your IDE
`git clone https://github.com/mrudulchaudhari/crowd_mt.git`
`python -m venv venv`
`./venv/Scripts/activate`

if 
`(venv) PS C:\Users\Mrudul\Desktop\Project\crowd_mt> `
(venv) like the above doesnt show up in your windows set up
then, Open Powershell
fo to repo path
`.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

If you see an error like “Execution of scripts is disabled”, run PowerShell as Administrator and type:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

This should work

then pull the requirements and ensure your system has npm
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
